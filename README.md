It is an online auction app. 
Authentiacation system is effectively implemented in this app so that only the verified user can get access to the app.
Here user can:
-bid the product
-like the product 
-save liked product to their profile
- view details of the product.
Main motive of this app is : "Bidding is made easier, simple and convenient".
This is the frontend part of my app.
